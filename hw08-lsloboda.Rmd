# Making a Shiny app

## Problem

The objective of the assignment is to add three features to the BC Liquor Shiny app and deploy it.

## Method

I modify the app by adding three new features:

1. Modify the output through a functional widget that sorts the results by price.

Hint: Use  to get TRUE/FALSE values from the user.

2. Change the UI by adding a few images. 

3. Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table.

Hint: Install the DT package, replace tableOutput() with DT::dataTableOutput() and replace renderTable() with DT::renderDataTable().

Next I deploy the app by:

* Upload to shinyapp.io

* Test functionality
